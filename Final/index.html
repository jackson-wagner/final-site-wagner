        <p>Caleb Kidder wore #37 his senior year at Montana. He was the only Grizzly player who had a legit chance at being drafted in this years class. He didn't get drafted, but he signed with the Minnesota Vikings after the draft and will get a tryout.</p>

            <p>JR missed half of the college season after failing a drug test, but he played well in the games he did appear in. The cornerback, #18, joined Trumaine Johnson as Grizzly defensive backs in the league after he signed with the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>

            <p>Yamen Sanders has the look of an NFL player, tall, athletic and incredibly strong. His ball skills are lacking, but his physical abilities earned him a try out for the Oakland Raiders.</p>
