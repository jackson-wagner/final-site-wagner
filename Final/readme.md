# Final Site

## Jackson Wagner

I decided to make my final site a personal site. One of my goals coming into this class was to be able to make a personal site for use in professional situations. While I'm not quite sure I have the design skills required to do that, I wanted to give it a shot and see what I could come up with. I used a lot of old photos to try to tell the story of what I like and what I'm up to these days. Part of that was a professional section, a section for my hobbies and activities, a throwback section and anything else really that I could think of.

I began by getting some photos to use for the site. I really liked when we worked with parallax sites, so I wanted to get some images that I thought could work as background photos. I collected the photos and saved them into my images folder.

After that, I began to build the site. I started with just a parallax view, starting with my professional headshot and working down to my professional experience, where I used a photo of the Montana Kaimin editorial staff as the background. I then included my hobbies, with a photo of me golfing as the background. Finally, I put in a little bit about Spokane Hoopfest, my favorite event ever, with a photo of my first team.

I tried to throw in some other elements to the page as well. I added a sticky header to teh top with links to move you down on the page. I unfortunately couldn't get my links to works, but the header shows up and moves along as you scroll. I also added a sidebar to my professional section that lists the other places that I've worked at to add in some extra content.

The containers that I put text into I also added a little design to, giving them an inset border to seperate them from the photos and mixing up the color.

The site looks how I imagined it would, but unfortunately I couldn't really get it to operate exactly how I wanted before I had to submit the project. I want to keep working to further my understanding of web design, and am very glad that I took this course.
