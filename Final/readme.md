# Final Site

## Jackson Wagner

I decided to make my final site a personal site. One of my goals coming into this class was to be able to make a personal site for use in professional situations. While I'm not quite sure I have the design skills required to do that, I wanted to give it a shot and see what I could come up with. I used a lot of old photos to try to tell the story of what I like and what I'm up to these days. Part of that was a professional section, a section for my hobbies and activities, a throwback section and anything else really that I could think of.
